Hey Day is an Auburn University tradition dating back to 1947, designed to foster unity and a welcoming atmosphere among students. On this day, students, faculty, and the Auburn community wear name tags and are encouraged to greet one another to build connections and create a sense of belonging. The event also includes festivities such as a pep rally, games, and a catered meal on the Campus Green. It is one of the university's longest-standing and most cherished traditions.
